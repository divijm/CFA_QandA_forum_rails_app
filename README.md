# QANDA Forum

## About

I was following along a tutorial online on 'How To Build A Forum In Rails' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTP1eMfI5Bs) by Mackenzie Child!

It was really good to do this as I built all the files of the app in a systematic process rather than just using the pre-built scaffold feature in Rails, to allow myself to have a better understanding on the whole MVC structure!

The app itself has a few bugs but the learning experience was valuable and will help me very soon as I begin my major project in Rails!
